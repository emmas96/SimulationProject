**Abstract**

The natural and intentional spread of infectious diseases through a population is a process of great importance to the modern, overpopulated and globalized society. Traditional epidemiological models do not take the individual information into account, thus have restricted ability to apprehend the intrinsic complexity of the disease spreading process. In order to overcome this limitation, agent-based models have been suggested as a successful approach to model complex disease spreading. In this paper an agent-based model for infectious disease is proposed for a greater understanding of disease spreading through a network of human contacts. By developing a base model, i.e an epidemiological model, into a more complex agent-based model, that model can be extended in the form of additional features to the environment as well as added behavioral changes to and differences between agents. It was shown that adding travellers to the simulations and lowering the threshold for when people exhibit a panic response, increased the likelihood of a population wide-spread disease. In conclusion, the natural response to panic and flee an area with potential danger, in this case has the undesired effect of helping a disease spread faster. The extensions of the model were made with the aim to make the model more realistic and to adjust it more to scenarios of intentional disease spreading, i.e bio-terrorism.
